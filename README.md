## Overview
Users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size - the layout is optimally configured for 2 screen sizes 
  - desktop: width - 1439px
  - tablet: width - 768px
  - mobile: width - 375px
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
  - this applies to the "location" component and social media icons.
- **Bonus**: Use [Leaflet JS](https://leafletjs.com/) to create an interactive location map with custom location pin

## My process
For this project, 2 pages are created:
* Landing page consists of 
  * image
  * text
  * location button
  * footer
* 2nd page consists of 
  * map
  * address
  * footer
### Built with

- CSS Grid and Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [React Router](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start)
### What I learned

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:
* CSS Grid layout
  * grid-template-columns &
  * grid-template-rows
  * clamp() to enable responsive text sizes

* Write optimal CSS for responsive layouts for different screen sizes. For example: 
  * avoid fixed width or height if possible  
  * use max/min-width or max/min-height
  * use CSS flexbox and grid for responsive layout
  * use of subgrid to allow for children element to have slightly different grid layout or inherit parent layout
### Continued development
* Unable to render the color for the landing page heading - "Modern Art Gallery" in 2 different colors --> require feedback on how this can be achieved
* Using typescript for the project
